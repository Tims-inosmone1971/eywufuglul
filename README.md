Just, wow, what even — what just happened?? Stumble out of that dark cave they call a theater, and it’s like there’s popcorn ghosts in every corner of my teeth. Back’s totally protesting like it’s 1984, remember that heinous couch in your uncle’s basement? Awful pain.

The Parenting was insane and also kind of reflective, right? Like raised anxiety to level 11 — the parents didn’t even know what they were doing half the time, and I swear at one point I related more to the freaking chandelier than the humans on screen. But beautifully shot, vibrant, you know? Glows like neon but credible glow worms, not tacky.

> And what was with that one scene where Mr. Dad thought he could cook lasagna while also fighting imaginary dragons?? I sorta drifted, maybe the lady behind me was talking or was it the snack wrappers – no, it was definitely both.

Oh, and that moment, remember? Don't want to spoil it—wait screw it, when the kid tossed the broccoli into the aquarium, like, thank you small human, even fish dodge veg these days! But the parents just... kept discussing how weird organic yogurt tastes. Unreal.

Also, whoever had the idea to make the soundtrack full of baby giggles is a mad genius or just bananas. Honestly, I think the piano could have done with a few more notes from the chaos tree, but not judging. I’m still recovering from that baby giggles Apocalypse.

God, someone asked me if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   – was it Carl? Yes, Carl who always eats cold cereal for breakfast and nothing else. Who lives like that? Anyway, I’d say he should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   cause his life's too predictable as is. But that file 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 better not buffer like my brain does.

Now my phone's got micro popcorn falls, tragic really. Mind still blowing like confetti in a wind tunnel— do give it a whirl if you’re into chaos that feels like dizzying parent karaoke.

C# code now, why even — whatever:
```csharp
int parentingLevel = random.Next(1, 10);
string advice = ?;
if (parentingLevel > 5) {
    Console.WriteLine(Parenting skills unlocked:  + advice);
} else {
    advice += Never mind.;
}
return fishTank;
```
Oops, if that runs, fish tanks might emit parenting advice now. Honestly, weirder things occurred in there.
